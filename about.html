        I'm taking this class to improve my front-end design skills. I've previously taken web design courses in my collegiate career, however, the bulk of my coding has been
        focused on back-end design. In this course I'm hoping to:
        <ul>
            <li>Improve and learn new techniques for front-end design</li>
            <li>Better understand how front-end elements may interact with back-end elements</li>
            <li>Be able to produce a professional-looking front-end website</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
